<h1>Lanikai</h1>


<p>When I was a freshmen in highschool I worked at market basket because I really wanted to adopt a dog. I saved up all my money and bought a maltese yorkie puppy and named her Lanikai. Lani is heaven in hawaiian and kai is ocean. She is now turning 4 in March and is my whole world. <p></p>

<h1>Cooper</h1>

<p>She grew up with a shitzu poodle named Cooper who had a huge personality. He died last year due to all of a sudden cancer. To this day Lani is very depressed and sad. She still runs on the beach but it is not the same doing it alone.</p>
